## Key Findings and Insights
- **Primary Water Sources:**  
  - Most residents rely on **rivers, wells, and taps** (home taps, broken taps, and shared taps).  
  - **Shared taps** are the most common in both **rural and urban areas**.  

- **Water Access Statistics:**  
  - **Only 34%** of the population has access to **basic water**.  
  - **66% lack basic access**, relying on **unsafe sources** or facing **long queue times**.  

- **Provincial Water Access Rates:**  
  - **Lowest Access:** Kilimani (**28%**)  
  - **Highest Access:** Amanzi (**41%**)  

- **Budget Allocation:**  
  - **Total Budget:** $147 million  
  - **Highest Allocation:** Sokoto (**$40M**)  
  - **Lowest Allocation:** Amanzi (**$13M**)  

- **Required Infrastructure Upgrades:**  
  - **Most Expensive:** Installing new public taps ($43M)  
  - **Least Expensive:** Repairing existing infrastructure ($2M)  

- **Cost per Citizen:**  
  - Estimated at **$5 per person** to fully fund the project.  

- **Improvements Per Province:**  
  - Each province will see **~4,000 new improvements** to restore access.

## Recommendations
1. **Increase Transparency & Public Engagement**  
   - Create a **public dashboard** to track project progress and spending.  
   - Share **periodic updates** on achievements and challenges.  
   - Improve **vendor accountability reporting** to ensure cost efficiency.  

2. **Prioritize High-Need Provinces**  
   - Focus interventions on **Kilimani (28%) and Sokoto (31%)**, where water access is lowest.  
   - Allocate **additional funding to rural areas**, as they have the highest demand.  

3. **Improve Cost Efficiency**  
   - Reallocate **over-budget funds** to high-impact areas.  
   - **Optimize vendor selection** by reducing reliance on high-cost suppliers.  
   - Invest in **bulk material purchases** to reduce unit costs.  

4. **Expand Alternative Water Sources**
