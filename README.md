## Key Findings and Insights
- **Primary Water Sources:**  
  - Maji Ndogo’s population’s primary sources of water are **Rivers, Wells and Taps**, of which include, *Tap in home* (a tap is found in a household and is functional), *Tap in 
    home broken* (a tap is found in a household but is not functional) and *Shared tap* (a tap is shared by multiple households). 
  - **Shared taps** are the most common in both **rural and urban areas** across **all provinces**.  

- **Water Access Statistics:**  
  - **Only 34%** of the population has access to **basic water**.
  - The 34% represents the population with **taps in their home** that are **functional**, households that **share a tap** with a **queue time less than 30 minutes** and **wells** 
    marked as **clean** by officials.
  - **66% lack basic access**, relying on **unsafe sources** or facing **long queue times**.  

- **Provincial Water Access Rates:**  
  - **Lowest Access:** Kilimani (**28%**)  
  - **Highest Access:** Amanzi (**41%**)  

- **Budget Allocation:**  
  - **Total Budget:** $147 million
